        <p>Healthy Eating, it is good and can be important to make a balanced diet or consider of eating foods and drinks that are generally healthy 
            for you and that it may be beneficial to your lifestyle, such as reconsider to eating foods that has vitamins, protein, calcium etc such as 
            for chicken it has a good amount of protein that is responsible for building & repairing your muscles and try have basic meals that can be 
            a mixed of healthy foods such as rice, pasta, sweetcorn, peas which of these does not only taste good with foods but are very healthy of eating 
            them on every week maybe perhaps once or twice a week should be fine.</p>

        <p>I would also suggest to eat foods that contain protein which I have mentioned about with the chicken however there are many foods that has high 
            in protein and can be good to be mixed with other foods that can be even more healthy and of course would give you a good taste such as having fried 
            eggs with baked beans as your breakfast which is very healthy because the yolk of a fried egg contains protein which is more essential for muscles 
            and baked beans contains not only protein but also fibre which is important for your digestive health and can be help with digestive problems, so 
            the reason why fried eggs with baked beans are good is because they both contain protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals and energy which is good to 
            include maybe for at least twice a week so that you are more healthy.</p>
            
        <p>I think it is a good idea to start drinking more water daily because they are imporant for functioning your body and keeping it healthy but according
            to many sites that it says it is important to drink up to 8 cups of water per day even it may sound quite dramtic but I don't think you need to necessarily
            have to but as long as your drink water every single day maybe get a litre of a wate bottle which should be enough for a day.</p>
