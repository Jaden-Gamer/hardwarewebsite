            <p>Sleeping habits is important to consider for trying to be healthy because sleeping helps with functioning the body
                by giving you energy to carry on the day and of course they are responsible for your improving cognitive functions,
                mood regulations, physical health, improved performance, cardiovascular health, metabolism, immune system etc. 
                Developing healthy sleeping habits is crucial for overall well-being and quality of life. Consistent and adequate 
                sleep supports cognitive function, emotional balance, and physical health.</p>

            <p>I have done my research for tips of improving your sleeps that can help with your lifestyle by going to bed at the
                same time for each night and then get up at the right time in the mornings because by doing this consistently then
                your brain will start adapting the times and then make it as a habit to automatically making you feel tired before
                you go to bed. I've heard that you need to get at least 7-9 hours of sleep which is important for your health and
                your brain functions. </p>
