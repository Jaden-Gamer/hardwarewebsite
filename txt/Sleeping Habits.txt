I have done my research for tips of improving your sleeps that can help with your lifestyle by going to bed at the same time for each night and then get up at the right time in the mornings because by doing this consistently then your brain will start adapting the times and then make it as a habit to automatically making you feel tired before you go to bed. I've heard that you need to get at least 7-9 hours of sleep which is important for your health and your brain functions.
